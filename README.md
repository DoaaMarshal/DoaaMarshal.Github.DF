Digital fabrication 
Hello I'm Doaa, here is my  documentation website of my digital fab project.


Software:

Autodesk Fusion 360 for 3D modelling
PrusaSlicer for slicing
Prusa 3D print for printing

# Week one :
Installtion of the software 
Brainstorming & Ideation

To find an idea to desgin, I started by listing random Ideas and  collecting  different  data for any idea I came up with,  and here is a list of  what I came up with:
Fashion & jewelry
Geometric shapes for  home decoration 
and Finally I decide to design something releated to my Sudanese cultrue ( Sudanses bridel jewellry)
But at the sametime I like the idea of combining the geometric shapes so I decides to design an jewelry using geometric shapes .

# week2
Sketching & low fidelity prototype 
 week 2 I start working on the shape of my module. 
 To have a better understanding of the shape and the connection,
 I prototyped it on paper and drew sketches using paper and pencil, sticky notes and scissors.
 here is a different images of what I did

Finally I decided working on those different shapes

# Week 3
Prototype in Fusion 360 and first print 
In this week Start using the software and watch tutorials because it wasn't easy enough to understand without watching some guides 
and also I try the printer and print my first pieces as shown here.

I started designing many different  ideas using fusion 360 as well

# Week 4
week4 printing and keep designing on !!
In this week I finally finalise my idea and start printing my different pieces 
I use 2 different shapes , different sizes and the same thickness for all of them .
 # Main sketch 

![sketch main pices](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71715660/219865315-5f9704d3-ef5d-45c2-a12a-914ef8e49aa5.png)

# week 5
In this week I start connect the different shapes which I already create as you might see here
# same shape different size 
![66a7184a-ccbc-43e6-b0eb-512fb18f6820](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71715660/219866348-03a2493e-db25-4c10-92d1-5f679f118cca.png)

 then I decide to Print again use different thickness, color, and add new 2 pieces as connector 
 This time I choose a 0.4mm thickness,instead of 0.35mm (by defult) and here are the results:

# Week6
Keep printing and try to connect the pieces .


This week was the most intense and complicated one ever   .
All students wanted to print, we all ran out of time. I spent 4/5 at the Fablab and printed just four times after waiting in a long queue ,  I was able to print a total of   78 pieces,most of them was not appropriate enough due to some issue in the printer I guess, So I was supposed to print more,
on 17/02 I was the first one who arrived to the lab with my colleague KiKi , we arrived at 7:40h and finish at 5h45 .
I was lucky enough to print two times, chanage the thinkness from 0.4mm to 0.6mm . although most of the pieces do not work properly when connected to each other .

# # This is what I was able to implement so far , But I am still motivated to do more and to make as many retouchers as I can to fix my project .

#As a future Implementation :

I want To  make these pieces  connected to each other  in a good and functional way 
I will design new connector with different dimension and different concept as well 
I will  add one more design to my Pieces 
I will print as much as I can 
Design I want to Add
