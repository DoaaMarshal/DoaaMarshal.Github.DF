Digital fabrication 
Hello I'm Doaa, here is my  documentation website of my digital fab project.


Software:

Autodesk Fusion 360 for 3D modelling
PrusaSlicer for slicing
Prusa 3D print for printing

#Week one :
Installtion of the software 
Brainstorming & Ideation

To find an idea to desgin, I started by listing random Ideas and  collecting  different  data for any idea I came up with,  and here is a list of  what I came up with:
Fashion & jewelry
Geometric shapes for  home decoration 
and Finally I decide to design something releated to my Sudanese cultrue ( Sudanses bridel jewelry)
But at the sametime I like the idea of combining the geometric shapes so I decides to design an jewelry using geometric shapes .

Sketching & low fidelity prototype 
 week 2 I start working on the shape of my module. Drawing sketchs using paper and pencil, sticky notes and scissors.
 here is a different images of what I did

Prototype in Fusion 360 and first print 
Start using the software and watch tutorilas because it wasn't easy engouh to understand without watching some guides 
and also I try the printer and print my first pices
