Digital fabrication 
Hello I'm Doaa, here is my  documentation website of my digital fab project.


Software:

Autodesk Fusion 360 for 3D modelling
PrusaSlicer for slicing
Prusa 3D print for printing

#Week one :
Installtion of the software 
Brainstorming & Ideation

To find an idea to desgin, I started by listing random Ideas and  collecting  different  data for any idea I came up with,  and here is a list of  what I came up with:
Fashion & jewelry
Geometric shapes for  home decoration 
and Finally I decide to design something releated to my Sudanese cultrue ( Sudanses bridel jewelry)
But at the sametime I like the idea of combining the geometric shapes so I decides to design an jewelry using geometric shapes .
